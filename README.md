# Insights:
1. The average cost of a car üöó  is ‚Ç¶5 million.
2. The average distance Nigerian used cars has been driven (mileage) is 28,000 kilometres (km).
(Note: A higher mileage typically suggests more use and potential wear on the vehicle's components, while lower mileage might indicate less wear and tear. Generally, a car with lower mileage tends to have a higher resale value.)
3. The average horsepower (the rate at which the engine can do work) is 217 hp.
A good horse power range for a car is around 150 - 250 hp.

4. The average engine size is 3,100 cubic centimetres (cc).
5. The most popular car make used/owned is Toyota, followed by Honda, then Lexus. 
6. The most popular car colour is Black ‚óºÔ∏è, followed by Grey, then silver.
7. Most drivers/car owners (94%) prefer automatic transmission cars. 
This might be because it's more convenient and less stressful to drive (it doesn't involve clutch and gear shifting).
8. Lagos state has the highest number of cars, while Anambra state has the least number.

# Recommendations:
The following actions are recommended:

1. Emphasize low mileage to attract buyers.
2. Stock more of the top selling car makes (Toyota, Honda, lexus) and colours (Black, grey, silver)
3. Stock more of automatic transmission cars, as they are in higher demand.
4. Focus marketing efforts on Lagos state, which has the highest number of cars.
